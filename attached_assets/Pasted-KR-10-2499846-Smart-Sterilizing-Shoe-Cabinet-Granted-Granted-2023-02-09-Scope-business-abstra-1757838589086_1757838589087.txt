KR 10-2499846 — Smart Sterilizing Shoe Cabinet (Granted)
Granted: 2023-02-09.
Scope (business abstract): Shoe-care cabinet architecture that performs in-cabinet sterilization and odor removal
under controlled airflow and safety interlocks.
Protectable elements: Cabinet structure for sterilization cycles; integrated control unit; in-enclosure treatment pathway;
safety interlock mechanism.
Commercial relevance: Hardware moat for cabinet-form shoe-care devices; foundation for manufacturing and
OEM/ODM deals.
KR 10-2023-0175107 — Smart Sterilizing Shoe Cabinet Including an Automatic Lift (Pending)
Filed: 2023-12-06. Application pending.
Scope (business abstract): Cabinet-type shoe-care system incorporating an automatic lift/positioning mechanism to
facilitate treatment and user access.
Protectable elements: Motorized/electromechanical lift; control logic coordinating lift movement with treatment
sequences; ergonomic handling.
Commercial relevance: Differentiates user experience (ergonomics, throughput); supports premium SKUs and
serviceability.
KR 10-2024-0147477 — Smart Shoe-Care System and Method (Pending)
Filed: 2024-10-25. Application pending.
Scope (business abstract): System-level workflow and control methods for automated shoe-care, including selection,
sequencing, and execution of care modes.
Protectable elements: End-to-end control logic; mode orchestration; device–sensor interactions; data logging for care
history.
Commercial relevance: Valuable method-layer coverage for software/firmware governance, third-party licensing, and
platform enforcement.
KR 10-2024-0165413 — AI Smart Shoe Cabinet Using Image Analysis (Pending)
Filed: 2024-11-19. Application pending.
Scope (business abstract): Image-analysis-driven identification of footwear characteristics to inform automatic care
selection inside a cabinet system.
Protectable elements: Vision pipeline (capture → analyze → decide); footwear classification features; decision
mapping from image features to care parameters.
Commercial relevance: Core to “auto-recognition → auto-care” differentiation; enables data services (usage analytics,
condition insights).
Also: Trademark Airet (KR 40-2023-0176480, filed 2023-09-26).
One-line summary: The granted patent secures the in-cabinet sterilization architecture; three pending filings extend
coverage to auto-lift ergonomics, system/method orchestration, and AI image analysis—protecting the full loop from
recognition to optimized treatment.
Rationale for Wording (Business-English):
Claim-neutral verbs: Phrases like “relates to / concerns / covers” describe scope without overcommitting, reducing
legal risk in IR decks.
Market-facing structure: Pairing each asset with ‘Protectable elements’ and ‘Commercial relevance’ helps
investors/partners tie IP to monetization.
Title normalization: Using globally familiar patterns (e.g., “System and Method,” “Using Image Analysis”) improves
readability for overseas readers.
